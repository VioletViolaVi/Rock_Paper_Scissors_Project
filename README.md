# Rock Paper Scissors Project

This project allows users to play the classic game of rock paper scissors. Users select from the rock paper scissors options which one they want to play out. Their choice is compared with the computer's, who also chooses among the options. Whoever deals the winning hand, wins the round and gains a point. There are 3 rounds. The player with the most wins after all the rounds is the winner, unless there is a tie. Then the game is considered a draw. This project uses HTML5 & CSS3 to add the code's structure & styling. JavaScript was used to make the project interactive. Google Fonts was used to provide the font style of the project. This website also was also made using responsive mobile first design, so it can be viewed and used on different screen sizes.
